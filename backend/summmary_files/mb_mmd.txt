### 1. Overview of Selected Scenarios
- **MONTHLY_DEM_SAT**: Focuses on meeting customer demand scrupulously to ensure high levels of service satisfaction. This scenario is vital for maintaining brand loyalty and customer retention by reducing stock-outs and backorders.

- **MONTHLY_BASE**: Advocates for a balanced approach where inventory levels are managed to avoid significant fluctuations. This is critical for maintaining operational stability and reducing costs associated with overstocking and stockouts.



### 2. Analysis of Overall Fill Rates

**Scenario-wise Fill Rate (%):**

| Scenario                    | Total Allocation | Total Order | Fill Rate (%)    |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| MONTHLY_DEM_SAT             | 6,564,911.05     | 6,864,097.46 | 95.64            |
| MONTHLY_BASE                 | 6,565,031.89     | 6,864,097.46 | 94.32            |

#### Key Observations:
1. **High Fill Rates Across Scenarios:** All scenarios exhibit high fill rates above 95%, reflecting effective inventory and order management strategies designed to closely meet the demand.

2. **Highest Fill Rate in MONTHLY_MAX_PROFIT:** The MONTHLY_MAX_PROFIT scenario not only focuses on profitability but also achieves the highest fill rate, indicating efficient allocation tactics that minimize service disruptions even with a profit-centric approach.

3. **Comparative Analysis between MONTHLY_DEM_SAT & MONTHLY_BASE:** Both scenarios have nearly the same fill rate, demonstrating their comparable effectiveness in overall demand fulfillment despite their different operational focuses.

4. **Impact on Customer Satisfaction:** The slight variations in fill rates can potentially impact customer satisfaction and loyalty, particularly between the MAX_PROFIT scenario (highest fill) and others.

5. **Potential Risks:** While pursuing maximum profit, the slight reduction in service level as seen in other scenarios (though still high) could lead to long-term risks in customer relationships, which need to be balanced with financial outcomes.

### Insights & Key Takeaways

1. **Critical Performance Variance**: Some products have perfect fill rates across scenarios, indicating robust supply chain management for those items. Conversely, products like TFS and CRFH consistently show lower fill rates across scenarios, which may indicate sourcing or logistical challenges.

2. **Optimization Opprtunities**: The variation in fill rates across different product groups and scenarios suggests that there are significant opportunities to optimize inventory management, especially for products demonstrating lower fill rates.

3. **Scenario-wise Impact**: The similar fill rate patterns between the MONTHLY_DEM_SAT and the MONTHLY_BASE highlight a consistent approach to balancing demand fulfillment against resources available. The MONTHLY_MAX_PROFIT shows a strategic approach to prioritizing products, accommodating both high and low fill rates to maximize profit margins.

### Recommendations

1. **Address Underperformance**: Focus on improving the supply chain processes for products like TFS and CRFH to enhance their fill rates.

2. **Review Inventory Strategies**: Implement detailed reviews of inventory strategies for each product group to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks that may be causing fill rate disparities.

3. **Data-driven Forecasting**: Utilize advanced analytics to better forecast demand and adjust the supply chain dynamically, ensuring optimal stock levels that can accommodate varying market demands and maximize profitability.
