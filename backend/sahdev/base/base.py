# Open-Source and Extending

Sahdev.AI is open-source and extensible. If you'd like to use Sahdev without the servers, see an example [here](https://Sahdev.ai/docs/postgres-ollama-chromadb/).

The following is an example of where various functions are implemented in the codebase when using the default "local" version of Sahdev. `Sahdev.base.SahdevBase` is the base class which provides a `Sahdev.base.SahdevBase.ask` and `Sahdev.base.SahdevBase.train` function. Those rely on abstract methods which are implemented in the subclasses `Sahdev.openai_chat.OpenAI_Chat` and `Sahdev.chromadb_vector.ChromaDB_VectorStore`. `Sahdev.openai_chat.OpenAI_Chat` uses the OpenAI API to generate SQL and Plotly code. `Sahdev.chromadb_vector.ChromaDB_VectorStore` uses ChromaDB to store training data and generate embeddings.

If you want to use Sahdev with other LLMs or databases, you can create your own subclass of `Sahdev.base.SahdevBase` and implement the abstract methods.

#             - For example, if a new column or condition is requested, update the prior query rather than creating a new one from scratch.

#             Now, based on the **CONTEXT** and **HISTORY**, intelligently determine whether the question is a follow-up or a new question, adapt the SQL query accordingly, and provide the updated result.
